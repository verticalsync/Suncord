<summary>Why does Suncord exist?</summary>

Suncord started out as a little fork just for me and my friends so it's easier to share plugins among the friend group and added our own badges alongside Vencord's just cause why not? But Suncord started to get talked about in servers such as E-Z image host & bio service, because one of the people in our friends group is a moderator there and had shown that he was on Suncord, so it caught the eyes of some of the people there and they were also interested in moving from Vencord to Suncord or just installing Suncord, it wasn't originally made for everyone, but since people have started using it, I've started maintaining it a bit better and pushing most new changes of Vencord to Suncord, and actively adding new plugins as I find them or get them suggested to me.

<summary>Using Suncord violates Discord's terms of service</summary>

Client modifications are against Discord’s Terms of Service.

However, Discord is pretty indifferent about them and there are no known cases of users getting banned for using client mods! So you should generally be fine as long as you don’t use any plugins that implement abusive behaviour. But no worries, all inbuilt plugins are safe to use!

Regardless, if your account is very important to you and it getting disabled would be a disaster for you, you should probably not use any client mods (not exclusive to Suncord), just to be safe

Additionally, make sure not to post screenshots with Suncord in a server where you might get banned for it
